# ASCII Art Output Project

This project provides a library for generating ASCII art and includes an output function to display the art. The program can write the result into a file when specified with the `--output` flag.

## Objectives

You must follow the same instructions as in the first subject while writing the result into a file.

- The file must be named by using the flag `--output=<fileName.txt>`, where `--output` is the flag and `<fileName.txt>` is the file name which will contain the output.
- The flag must have exactly the same format as above. Any other formats must return the following usage message:
Usage: go run . [OPTION] [STRING] [BANNER]

EX: go run . --output=<fileName.txt> something standard

- If there are other ASCII art optional projects implemented, the program should accept other correctly formatted `[OPTION]` and/or `[BANNER]`.
- The program must still be able to run with a single `[STRING]` argument.

## Instructions

- Your project must be written in Go.
- The code must follow good practices.
- It is recommended to have test files for unit testing.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ascii-art.git

# Change directory into the project folder
cd ascii-art

# Install dependencies (if any)
go mod tidy
Usage
To use the ASCII art generator, follow these instructions:


# Generate ASCII art and print to console
go run . "hello" standard

# Generate ASCII art and write to output.txt
go run . --output=output.txt "hello" standard
Examples
Print to Console:


go run . "hello" standard
Write to File:


go run . --output=output.txt "hello" standard
Invalid Format:


go run . --out=output.txt "hello" standard
# This will return:
# Usage: go run . [OPTION] [STRING] [BANNER]
#
# EX: go run . --output=<fileName.txt> something standard
